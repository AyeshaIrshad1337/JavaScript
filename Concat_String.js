// // Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
// Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.
const myStr = "This is the start."+" This is the end."; // Change this line
// Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

// Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.
let myStr = 'This is the first sentence.';
myStr+=' This is the second sentence.';
