<h2>Declare JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p>In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.</p>
<p>For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.</p>
<p>Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.</p>
<p>We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:</p>
<code>var ourName;</code>
  
<h2>Storing Values with the Assignment Operator</h2>
<p>n JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).</p>
<code>myVariable = 5;</code>
<p>This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.</p>

<p>If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.
</p>
<code>
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
</code>
<p>
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.</p>
